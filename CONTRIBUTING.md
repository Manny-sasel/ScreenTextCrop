## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Python style guidelines

- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Code Example
```python
def extract_text_from_image(image: Image.Image, config: str = '--psm 6') -> str:
    """
    Extract text from an image using OCR.
    
    Args:
        image: PIL Image object to extract text from
        config: Tesseract configuration string
        
    Returns:
        Extracted text as string
        
    Raises:
        OCRException: If text extraction fails
    """
    try:
        return pytesseract.image_to_string(image, config=config)
    except Exception as e:
        raise OCRException(f"Failed to extract text: {str(e)}")
```

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add support for custom OCR configurations"
git commit -m "Fix window positioning on multi-monitor setups"
git commit -m "Update README with installation troubleshooting"

# Less ideal
git commit -m "Fix bug"
git commit -m "Update stuff"
git commit -m "Changes"
```
